"More than half of the utilities analyzed
increased the price of water regardless of the
amount a household used, resulting in price
increases for all single-family households."

"Drought charges exacerbated affordability
concerns for low-income households. Singlefamily households earning less than $25,000
a year paid an average of 1.8 percent of their
household income for basic water service
without drought charges. This amount
increased to 2.1 percent with drought charges,
exceeding State of California and United States
Environmental Protection Agency affordability
thresholds."

"The effect was even more extreme
for households earning less than $10,000,
raising costs from 4.4 to 5.3 percent of income.
These households have little or no disposable
income, so any increase in water costs poses a
major problem."

So for validation step 1:
	* Household less than 25k, 1.8% of income pre-drought, to 2.1% of income during drought
	* Households less than 10k, 4.4 to 5.3% of income
	* 


# repayment

Bonds are a means of borrowing to undertake long-term investment. Typically repaid over
30-40 years General Oblication bonds (GO) are backed by the
trust in the municipality issuing the bond and are repaid by tax dolalrs.

Revenue bonds are repaid by specific revenues from the project being financed
(https://www.ppic.org/content/pubs/report/R_314EHR.pdf)


"Many local utilities issue revenue bonds, repaid by an assortment of fee income, including water and
wastewater service fees, and developer fees, plus occasionally special taxes"

GO bonds must be used for 'construction or acquisition of cpital assets' which are physical assets lasting 15 years or more (CA GS 16727(a))
