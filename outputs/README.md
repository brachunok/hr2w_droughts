# Outputs

Outputs does not get touched by humans. Only code writes to here (code from the code folder) and only code reads from here (code in analysis) 


## Naming Conventions 
TBD

We need a way to name files so that we know what experiments were used to create each file. 

To incorperate:
(1) The date the file was run
(2) Any parameter changes

## File descriptions
* drought_caracteristic is the file in the data folder that we are running 
* income_distribution is the # of households of each type
* fee_passthrough changes how the water rates are incresed
* reservoir size is the size of the reservoir
* pbp and discount rate govern how the infrastructure projects are financed (used to calculate monthly loan payments)
* mitigation decision is curtaioment or buying market water (baseline is curtailment)
* build is which specific item we are building
* water_cost is the cost/AF of buying water on the market
*
