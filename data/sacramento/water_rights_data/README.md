# Use from each water right

In the [UWMP](https://www.cityofsacramento.org/~/media/Corporate/Files/DOU/2015%20UWMP%20June%202016Appendices.pdf)

there are water rights listed on page 6-6

Their permit numbers are: 
00992
11358
11359
11360
11361

If you take those and go to [this website](https://ciwqs.waterboards.ca.gov/ciwqs/ewrims/EWServlet?Redirect_Page=EWWaterRightPublicSearch.jsp&Purpose=getEWAppSearchPage) which lets you search for water rights, you can find the actual amount used (at least for some) for each MONTH

These get reported in the data files

## Note 
In sacramento, there was a change in which prior to 2014 all water rights had the total used in each right reproted for each. There will be situations in which there are 2 reports for the same year. Pull the data from the more-newly-created report. It should be 1/4th of the older report. In the old reports, they were reportin the total water used for ALL water rights in each one where in the newer reports they are just dividing by 4
