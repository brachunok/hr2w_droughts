# Use from each water right

In the UWMP https://www.cityofsacramento.org/~/media/Corporate/Files/DOU/2015%20UWMP%20June%202016Appendices.pdf

there are water rights listed on page 6-6

Their permit numbers are: 
00992
11358
11359
11360
11361

If you take those and go to this website: https://ciwqs.waterboards.ca.gov/ciwqs/ewrims/EWServlet?Redirect_Page=EWWaterRightPublicSearch.jsp&Purpose=getEWAppSearchPage which lets you search for water rights, you can find the actual amount used (at least for some) for each MONTH

These get reported in the data files
